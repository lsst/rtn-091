\section{Introduction}

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory\cite{2019ApJ...873..111I} will go in to operations in 2025.
During commissioning we have already seen our infrastructure as code based cyber system working well.
In this paper we will describe the generic underlying hardware, deployments on that hardware of both bare metal and containerized applications, transmission of data to SLAC and our NIST\cite{NIST.SP.800-171r3} compliant security approach.
