\section{Networking Layer} \label{sec:networking}

There are many devices on the Rubin summit network all of which must work in coordination to deliver smooth operations, hence reliability and scalability are important.
Following NIST \citep{NIST.SP.800-171} has also led us to some further segmentation ans isolation.
For automation all the networking configuration is Infrastructure as code using Ansible.

\subsection{Reliability}

To make the summit operations secure and reliable the operational hardware is held in the \emph{pixel zone}
\figref{fig:pixel-zone}.
This isolates all operational machines with a 2FA VPN.
Device addresses and ports are restricted on all pixel zone machines ensuring we understand the traffic that
is supposed to be flowing and restricting any odd behavior.
