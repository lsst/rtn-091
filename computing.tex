\section{Computing Layer} \label{sec:computing}

Driven by our requirements of high reliability, cyber resilience and having a small team we have strive for as much automation as we can get.
In \secref{sec:physical} we spoke about the reusable bricks at the summit.
This in turn pushes us toward containerization for as much as possible so that any component can run on any brick.
Once we have  bunch of container we need orchestration here we turn to kubernetes which we use across all Rubin sites including Google \citep{2021arXiv211115030O}.
